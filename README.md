Horiseon Project

I First Changed the adult elements from <div> to elements like <header> and <section>.

I then went on to adjust a few CSS elements that had been affected by the change in adult elements.

Afterwards I made sure the HTML was in sequencial order and made sure it looked organized.

I also added alt attributes after <src> codes.

Once I was finished that I fixed the links that were broken and added <id=> to make them work.

I then organized the CSS page to make sure it was also in semantic order.
